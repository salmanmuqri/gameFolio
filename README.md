Welcome to **Gamefolio**! This is an interactive showcase of web-based games that I’ve developed. Each game represents my passion for coding and my journey through JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. Feel free to explore the games, check out the source code, and play them directly from the browser!

## Introduction
This project is designed as an interactive portfolio to display a variety of web-based games I’ve built. Each game demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Whether you’re a fellow developer or a game enthusiast, I hope you enjoy exploring the creativity and functionality packed into these games.

### Why this Portfolio

**Showcase of Web-Based Games**: The games are fully playable in the browser and serve as a demonstration of my abilities in front-end development.
- **Open Source**: All the games are open-source, and their source codes are available for learning, contributing, or forking.
- **Interactive Design**: The website itself is designed with smooth animations, transitions, and a clean UI, ensuring that the experience is as enjoyable as the games themselves.
